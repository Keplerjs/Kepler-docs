title: Namespace
---

Most of the logic and configuration modules are contained in [keplerjs:core](https://github.com/Keplerjs/Kepler/tree/master/packages/core/README.md) under the [Kepler namespace](https://github.com/Keplerjs/Kepler/tree/master/packages/core/Kepler.js) **Kepler.** or **K.** is the same thing. Inside this namespace the general rule is that *Modules* or *Models* are capitalized instead the configuration objects are lowercase.
The views that define the base **User Interface** structure of Kepler are contained in [keplerjs:core-ui](https://github.com/Keplerjs/Kepler/tree/master/packages/core-ui/README.md). This also contains the [helpers templates](https://github.com/Keplerjs/Kepler/tree/master/packages/core-ui/client/helpers.js) used by all views and the minimum CSS essential for the behavior of the UI.
