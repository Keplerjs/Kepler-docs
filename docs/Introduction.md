## Introduction
Kepler is a open source [geo-social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosocial_networking) solution that lets users share favorite places and join discussions in real-time. It can be seen as a platform where users can interact with other open data platforms searching across [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about), [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) among other sources.
The name as the best Meteor tradition wants to remain in the space field, *Kepler* is inspired by [Kepler space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_Mission) and wants to be seen as an sequel of the first and largest open source Meteor projects the old *Telescope* current *[VulcanJS](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/vulcan.html)*.

### Mission
Allows users to collect and georeferencing places on a modern web-mapping interface, describe them accurately, create relationships, sharing with other users and create a social environment. In addition to creating new place you can import pre-existing objects from Openstreetmap creating a social layer over OpenStreetMap.
A place in Kepler can be linked to metadata from different sources automatically, it can be anything that has a geographic location fixed or movable, real or virtual.

### Principles

* **full-stack**: developed 100% in JavaScript using the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) the best nodejs fullstack framework.
* **real-time**: all events and changes within the platform are automatically transmitted from the server to the clients
* **geo-social**: the main user interface is a web map contains objects that represent places, users and others
* **framework**: gives developers the ability to extend basic functionalities through an environment and a API
* **extensible**: development is based on an easily buildable plugin architecture

### Expectations
In the near future Kepler as any open source projects will follow a community-driven evolution that will support it instead of the initial mission ad we hope it has growth beyond expectations.
