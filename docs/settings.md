A example of custom settings is [settings.sample.json](https://github.com/Keplerjs/Kepler/blob/master/private/settings.sample.json) other special settings of individual plugins can be overridden always using this same file.
To see *packages/plugin-name/plugin.js* file in the *settings* section.

```sh
meteor --settings private/settings.sample.json 
```
